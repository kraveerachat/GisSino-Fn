## Current state

A responsive mock-data dashboard implemented in [blue-screens.js](../../../src/blue-screens.js) and [screens.js](../../../src/screens.js). It has no persistence or real financial connection.

## Purpose and rules

- Show balance, accounts, recent activity, upcoming obligations, and habit continuity [DECIDED].
- Keep sample-data disclosure visible and avoid presenting simulated actions as saved [DECIDED].
- Safe-to-spend behavior follows the Project Guide; production calculation remains unimplemented [PROPOSED].

## Sections and details

No Level-3 notes exist yet.

## Data and engines used

Synthetic fixtures only. Future balance, obligation, FX, and habit engines are described in [System Architecture](../../architecture/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## States and edge cases

The screen map records sample, empty, loading, error, and unavailable preview states. Real network and persistence failures are [OPEN].

## Decisions and open questions

Navigation follows [D23](../../project/DECISIONS.md#d23--responsive-primary-navigation).

## Change log

- 2026-10-16 — Added to the vault from the current prototype and [Screen Map](../../design/SCREEN_MAP.md).
